# Tampermonkey Tools
All the scripts within this repository are improvements aspiring for a better web, implemented on the shape of addon scripts injected on to webs by means of [Tampermonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampermonkey).
In order to benefit from these tools, do install the extension on your favorite browser:
 - Chrome: [Install Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
 - Firefox: [Install Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
 - Edge: [Install Link](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
 
 This is among my first projects that I upload, and it'd be a great ego boost if you click that pretty Star button up on the top right part of the project: that'll mean that there's someone out there who found these things useful, fun or interesting.
 
 Without further due, these are the scripts that I offer:

## Show Amazon content on Gmail (based on Reference Numbers)
Receiving a bunch of amazon emails with reference numbers on them, but no other way of identifying what is that email relating to? Tired of accessing amazon with that reference number every time you want to figure out what you will be receiving today?

Then install this script from this repo. You will have a display of the products related to any reference number shown on gmail as soon as you hover on them.

## Noticias Anti Popup
Reading the news in spanish newspapers is a complete pain, constantly asking you to disable AdBlock or asking you to log in.
This script keeps monitoring for that annoying panel to appear and automatically removes it on a breeze. No drama, just news.
Supported pages:
 - 20minutos.es
 - Elmundo.es
 - elpais.com
 - abc.es

## Clean Youtube (adapt Video to the very edge of the window 
I usually multitask, and I like having some youtube video on its own window, on the very bottom right part of my screen, visible but not taking too much space (also to check [AlwaysOnTop](https://www.labnol.org/software/tutorials/keep-window-always-on-top/5213/) to keep that window on top of whatever you may have).
Annoyingly enough, the video panel on youtube appears only after the Youtube header, to the right of a padding... always far away from the very border of the window.
This script provides with an extra button on Youtube to remove everything between the video and the borded of the window, so you can see the video and the video alone.
