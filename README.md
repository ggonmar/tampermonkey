# [Tampermonkey] Show Amazon content on Gmail (based on Reference Numbers)
Receiving a bunch of amazon emails with reference numbers on them, but no other way of identifying what is that email relating to? Tired of accessing amazon with that reference number every time you want to figure out what you will be receiving today?

Fear not, this script is here for you. Plainly install tampermonkey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampermonkey) on your favorite browse:

Chrome: [Install Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
Firefox: [Install Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
Edge: [Install Link](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
And then install this script from this repo. After that, you will have a display of the products related to any reference number shown on gmail as soon as you hover on them.
